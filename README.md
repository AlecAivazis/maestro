# Maestro

A project management and build system built for developers with everyone else in mind

## Running locally

First you must install kafka, for instructions see [here](https://dtflaneur.wordpress.com/2015/10/05/installing-kafka-on-mac-osx/).

Then run the start script to choose which services you want to run (not yet implemented):

```bash
go run main.go
```
