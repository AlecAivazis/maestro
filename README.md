## Running locally

First you must install kafka, for instructions see [here](https://dtflaneur.wordpress.com/2015/10/05/installing-kafka-on-mac-osx/).

Starting kafka is easy with `run` installed:

``` bash
run dev
```

Then run the start script to choose which services you want to run (not yet implemented):

```bash
go run main.go
```
